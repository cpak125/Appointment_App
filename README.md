## Overview
A proof of concept for a full-stack application that provides multiple time slots for appointments, which users can reserve.

Upon entering the application, the user is greeted with a list of clickable time slots. Once a time slot is clicked, a modal pops up requesting for the user's name and phone number. After submission of the user's information, the time slot selected turns red, indicating the time slot is no longer available. If the red time slot is clicked on again the modal pops up with the name and phone number for that appointment prepopulated. Users are able to edit the name and phone number to change the user for the appointment.
